========================================



Parameters to consider, in order of importance, for this particular spot.
1) Primary Swell Period
2) Wind
3) Swell Interruption (number of swell and how they interact)
4) Swell Direction
5) Swell Size   
6) Local 'chop'
7) Wind Direction

Rating system:

5 Star = Glass, with little local chop and Epic tidy Period, little interruption from other swells. S to SM = Any Tide. SM - Mid = Mid-tide. ML - L = High Tide. North to Western Swell. Size at least Mid.
4 Star = Glass/Light Wind, Low to Litte chop, Good to Epic Main Swell, little to ML swell interruption. S to SM = Any Tide. SM - Mid = Mid-tide. ML - L = High Tide. Starting at Med-Small Swell. Any direction.
3 Star = Not Blown. Tolerate until mid chop. Only Mid-Interruption. As long as its not Tiny and high tide, or Mutant/Large and mid to low tide. All good. Any Size, Any direction.
2 Star = Any Wind. Not terrible Chop. Can be mixed Swells. As long as its not Tiny and high tide, or Mutant/Large and mid to low tide. All good. Any size any direction.
1 Star = The Rest - Makaha is always Surfable. Any Size any direction

Split Ratings (And their Weights)
- Size Score 1 - 5 -- Normalised[(Size of primary Swell) + 0.2(Size of Secondary Swell)]
- Tidiness Score (1 - 5) -- Normalised[Period + Swell Interruption]
- Glassiness Score (1 - 5) -- Normalised[Wind Speed + Wind Wave Height + 0.3(Wind Direction)]
- Optimal Direction-ness (1 - 5) -- Normalised[Degrees away from the 270 - 320 degree direction]
- Closed-out? ( 0 - 1) -- Binary If function Function(Tide*Primary Swell Size)


Parameter Score (Each scored --- 1 to 5)

XXXXXX Wind: 
	<7 = Glass --- 5
	7-10 = Light Wind --- 4
	10-12 = Windy --- 3
	>12 = Blown --- 1

XXXXXX Wind Direction:
	Terrible: 170 to 280 --- 1
	Cross: 90 - 170; 280 - 350 --- 4
	Off: 350 - 90 --- 5
	
XXXXXX Local wind chop (Wind wave height, direction doesnt matter)
<0.1 = Little Chop --- 5
0.1 - 0.2 = Low --- 4
0.2 - 0.3 = Mid  ---3
>0.3 = Terrible ---1


XXXXXX Swell Interruption (Delta of Swell 1 and Swell 2)

normalized_score 
Strong Interf = --- 1
Moderate Interf --- 2
Mild Interf --- 4
Minimal Interf --- 5

*The Following parameters determine the total Swell Interruption. The scored are linearly added up to 15 and then re-normalised to 
	Directional Difference:

	0-20° difference: Score 4 (Minimal interference)
	20-40° difference: Score 3 (Mild interference)
	40-90° difference: Score 2 (Moderate interference
	)
	>90 difference: Score 1 (Strong interference)
	
	Period Difference:
	0-2 seconds difference: Score 4 (Minimal interference)
	2-5 seconds difference: Score 3 (Mild interference)
	5-10 seconds difference: Score 2 (Moderate interference)
	10+ seconds difference: Score 1 (Strong interference)

	Size Difference:
	0-25% of the size of the dominant swell: Score 4 (Minimal interference)
	25-50% of the size: Score 3 (Mild interference)
	50-75% of the size: Score 2 (Moderate interference)
	75-100% or greater: Score 1 (Strong interference)

Tide (Categories and NOT score, only really affects SMALL and LARGE Swells
High: More than 0.2
ML: 0 to 0.2
MS:0 to -0.2
Low: Less than -0.2

XXXXX Primary Swell Size: 
0 - 0.6 = XS --- 1
0 - 1m = S --- 2
1m - 2m = MS --- 3
2m = M --- 4
2 - 3 = L --- 5
3m + = XL --- 1 (Because in general itll be closing out)

XXXXX Primary Swell Direction (Out of 5)
Best = 220 - 320 --- 5
Medium = The Rest --- 2

XXXXX Primary Swell Period:
	<10 = Worst --- 1
	<12 = Bad --- 2
	12 - 14 = Medium --- 3
	14 - 16 = Good --- 4
	16 - 20 = Epic --- 5
