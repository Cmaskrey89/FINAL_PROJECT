# Surf Forecast for "La Reventazon de Makaha"
#### Video Demo: <>
#### Description: 
This project uses a freely-available API (Stormglass) of sea and weather conditions to evaluate the surf conditions of my local break in Lima, Peru ("La Reventazon de Makaha") based on my experience of suring it. The inspiration came from the lacklustre rating performance of generalised surf forecast websites like surf-forecast.com and surfline.com, who provide accurate surf conditions but a largely inaccurate evaluation of conditions for a final surf rating.
